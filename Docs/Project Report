  Our project wanted to provide users a recommendation on new TV shows or movies to watch on Netflix based on their mood. 
We planned to allow the user to type in how they were feeling and run that through IBM Watsonâ€™s Sentiment Analysis API and 
output suggestions that fit their mood using an unofficial Netflix API. Users could log in to save their recommendations by 
logging in with Google as third party authentication. We used MongoDB as our database to show results to the user.

  There were some challenges in working on this project, with the main one relating to our second API, the unofficial Netflix API.
After working on getting the Netflix API to return suggestions on the web application, it one day stopped running with the 
message that the user was not subscribed to the API, even though we were. Furthermore, when working with the third party 
authentication, we could get the authentication to work but then the API would stop working, or vice versa. Given the time 
limitations and some of the setbacks we faced we tried our best to make our project what we envisioned it to be.
